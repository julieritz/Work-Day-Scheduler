# Description of design

Using jQuery, I used to functions to:

1. Set the day of week and date
2. Get local data from storage so that it will stay on page in correct time-block when refreshed
3. Check for validity
4. Set corresponding events to hours
5. Update the time blocks with the scheudle data
6. Save that data and
7. Add event listener for save button
```
